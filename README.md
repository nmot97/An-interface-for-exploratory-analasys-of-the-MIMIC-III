# An interface for exploratory analysis of the MIMIC-III database
MIMIC-III is the third edition of a freely accessible medical database, containing varied
records of over forty-six thousand patients. Used worldwide by many scientists and
researchers as a basis for their work and studies. However, it is not accompanied by any
kind of interface to help its users get to know it better or the data it contains, which with
dozens of gigabytes in size. The first contact with it can be quite intimidating and will require,
necessarily, its user programming skills to, at least, extract general information from it due
to its enormous size.
The objective of this work is to create a graphical interface that collects data regarding
patients from this database, relates the various tables present in it, and presents relevant
information in a simple way, but without neglecting functionality.
Through graphs, tables and text generated in real time, the user is able to get to know a lot
of details about the database without needing to know any kind of programming language.
