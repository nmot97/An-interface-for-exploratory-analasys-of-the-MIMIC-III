# An interface for exploratory analysis of the MIMIC-III database

MIMIC-III is the third edition of a freely accessible medical database, containing varied records of over forty-six thousand patients. Used worldwide by many scientists and researchers as a basis for their work and studies. However, it is not accompanied by any kind of interface to help its users get to know it better or the data it contains, which with dozens of gigabytes in size. The first contact with it can be quite intimidating and will require, necessarily, its user programming skills to, at least, extract general information from it due to its enormous size. 

The objective of this work was to create a graphical interface on R that collects data regarding patients from this database, relates the various tables present in it, and presents relevant information in a simple way, but without neglecting functionality.
Through graphs, tables and text generated in real time, the user is able to get to know a lot of details about the database without needing to know any kind of programming language.

NOTE: database files contaning patients data was removed for privacy reasons, in order to this interface work is necessary do include them on the main directory.
